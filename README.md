### Overview
Kibako Engine is a lightweight graphics framework experimenting with:
- Low-level Direct3D 11 rendering
- Basic 2D/3D systems and resource management
- Simple and transparent design (educational purpose)

This repository serves as a **learning and experimentation ground** for graphics programming and engine architecture in C++.

---

### Current Focus
- Core renderer setup (device, swap chain, context)
- Basic sprite rendering pipeline
- Resource management (textures, shaders)
- Logging and diagnostics
