### Overview
Kibako Engine is an **experimental graphics framework** currently in **very early development**.  
At this stage, it supports **2D rendering**, with **3D capabilities planned** for the future.  
The goal is to explore engine architecture, rendering systems, and resource management in a clear and lightweight way.

---

### Development Status
This project is **not stable**, and APIs will change frequently.  
Many systems are still incomplete or placeholder-only.  
The focus right now is on building a **solid, understandable foundation** before moving on to advanced rendering features.
