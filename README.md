### Overview
Kibako Engine is an **experimental graphics framework** currently in **very early development**. 
Currently, it can only render in **2D**, though **3D** is planned for the future.
The goal is to explore engine structure, rendering systems, and resource management in a clear and lightweight way.

---

### Development Status
This project is **not stable** and APIs will change frequently.  
Many systems are incomplete or placeholder-only.  
The goal right now is to establish a **solid and understandable foundation** before expanding to more complex rendering features.
