### Overview
Kibako Engine is an **experimental graphics framework** currently in **very early development**.  
The goal is to explore engine structure, rendering systems, and resource management in a clear and lightweight way.

This project is built for **learning purposes** and will evolve gradually over time — expect constant changes and experimentation.

---

### Current Focus
- Core Direct3D 11 setup (device, swap chain, context)
- Basic 2D rendering pipeline
- Texture and shader management
- Logging and diagnostics utilities

---

### Development Status
This project is **not stable** and APIs will change frequently.  
Many systems are incomplete or placeholder-only.  
The goal right now is to establish a **solid and understandable foundation** before expanding to more complex rendering features.
