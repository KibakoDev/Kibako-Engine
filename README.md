## 🧩 Overview
**Kibako Engine** is an experimental graphics framework currently in **very early development**.  
At this stage, it supports **2D rendering**, with **3D capabilities planned** for the future.  

The goal is to explore:
- Engine architecture and modular system design  
- Real-time rendering and resource management  
- Clean and understandable code structure

This project is primarily focused on **learning and experimentation**, not production use.

---

## ⚙️ Development Status
This project is **not stable** and APIs will change frequently.  
Many systems are incomplete or serve as placeholders.  

The current focus is on:
- Building a **solid foundation** for rendering and engine flow  
- Implementing a **debug/logging layer**  
- Testing architecture scalability before adding complexity
